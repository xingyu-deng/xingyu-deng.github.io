I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Sheffield, working on scientific fact-checking under the supervision of [Dr. Xi Wang](https://www.xiwangeric.com/) and [Dr. Mark Stevenson](https://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/M.Stevenson/). Broadly, I am interested in topics related to fact-checking, including information retrieval, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and natural language processing for verifying scientific claims. My existing work focuses on bridging the gap in evidence retrieval for scientific fact-checking, developing specialised retrieval systems capable of handling complex, full-paper scientific literature rather than simplified abstract-level datasets.

Prior to beginning my PhD journey, I studied at the University of Manchester for five years and earned my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Computer Science. 
I became interested in AI during a research project supervised by [Prof. Steve Furber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber), and later explored healthcare fact-checking in my master’s project under the supervision of [Prof. Goran Nenadic](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/gnenadic). I am especially grateful to my tutor [Dr. Oliver Rhodes](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/oliver.rhodes), whose support and encouragement helped me navigate a particularly challenging period.
