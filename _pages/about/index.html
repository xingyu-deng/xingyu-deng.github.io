<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Sheffield, working on scientific fact-checking under the supervision of <a href="https://www.xiwangeric.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Xi Wang</a> and <a href="https://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/M.Stevenson/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Mark Stevenson</a>. Broadly, I am interested in topics related to fact-checking, including information retrieval, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and natural language processing for verifying scientific claims. My existing work focuses on bridging the gap in evidence retrieval for scientific fact-checking, developing specialised retrieval systems capable of handling complex, full-paper scientific literature rather than simplified abstract-level datasets.</p> <p>Prior to beginning my PhD journey, I studied at the University of Manchester for five years and earned my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Computer Science. I became interested in AI during a research project supervised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Steve Furber</a>, and later explored healthcare fact-checking in my master’s project under the supervision of <a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/gnenadic" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Goran Nenadic</a>. I am especially grateful to my tutor <a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/oliver.rhodes" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Oliver Rhodes</a>, whose support and encouragement helped me navigate a particularly challenging period.</p> </body></html>
